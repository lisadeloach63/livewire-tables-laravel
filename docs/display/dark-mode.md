**This feature is available in v1.15 and above**

Out of the box this package comes with dark mode styles for **Tailwind** only. You must [set up dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) through Tailwind for this to work.

**Tip:** Dark mode looks best when placed on a `bg-gray-900` background.
